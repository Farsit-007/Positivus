# Pipeline Evidence

Add the following artefacts after running the Jenkins pipeline:

1. `pipeline-run.log` – Raw console output from a successful run (build → test → package → deploy → health-check).
2. `pipeline-screenshot.png` – Screenshot of the Jenkins UI showing the successful stage view.

These files are intentionally absent from source control until you generate them locally. Keep this README as a reminder of the required deliverables.
